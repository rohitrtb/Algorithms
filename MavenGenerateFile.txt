mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.sorting.insertionSort -DartifactId=InsertionSort -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false

This creates a folder called InsertionSort and the directory structure is something similar to this:
my-app
| -- pom.xml
  -- src
	|-- main
	|   -- java
	|     --com
	|	--mycompany
	|	  --app
	|	    --App.java
	-- test
	  --java
	    --com
	      --mycompany
		--app
		  --AppTest.java


Build the project: mvn package
This is just a phase. A phase is a step in the build life-cycle which is an ordered sequence of phases. When a phase is given, maven will execute every phase in the 
sequence upto the one and including the one defined in the command. For example:
mvn compile
1. validate
2. generate-sources
3. process-sources
4. generate-resource
5. process-resources
6. compile

We can test the newly compiled and packaged JAR with the following command:
java -cp target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.mycompany.app.App

Maven Phases:
Default Lifecycle phases in maven:
1. validate: validate the project and all necessary information is available
2. compile: compile the source code of the project
3. test: test the compiled source code using a test framework. The test should not require the code to be packaged or deployed
4. integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary and then run the tests
5. verify: run any checks to verify if the package is valid and meets the quality criteria
6. install: install the package into local repository for use as dependency in other projects locally
7. deploy: deploy the pacakge

a. clean: cleans up artifacts from the previous build
b. site: generates site documentation for the project. Documentation is generated under target/site.
